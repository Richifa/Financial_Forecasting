# Background:<br>
We used the Fundamentals.csv and Securities.csv files provided by Kaggle.<br> 
The Fundamentals file provides the fundamental financial data gathered from SEC 10K annual filings from 448 companies listed on the S&P 500 index.<br> 
The Securities file provided the industry or sector information the companies are categorized under on the S&P 500 index<br>
